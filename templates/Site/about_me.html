        My name is Jocelyn, or Josie, and I am an information technology professional and freelance Python
        developer in the United States passionate about building unique and fully-customized websites that distinctly represent
        my clients' purpose. Aside from software development, I enjoy expanding my IT toolkit in other areas such as 
        Linux system administration, writing applications for personal projects, and network security.

        When I am not focused on technology I enjoy taking a break from sitting indoors so I can tend to my physical 
        and mental health through exercise, meditation, and attending events and social gatherings with like-minded
        individuals in my community.
