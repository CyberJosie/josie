<p>
    Thanks for taking some time to view my portfolio. This page acts as an online resume for myself and includes my
    background and professional experience. If you are viewing from a desktop device or large tablet you can jump to
    specific
    sections of my portfolio by clicking the 'Portfolio' menu button and selecting it from the dropdown. For mobile
    users the
    dropdown button has been relocated to the bottom-right of your display.
</p>
<p>
    If you need more information than what is available here you can request access to an extended version of my
    portfolio
    via submitting a request online. To request access, use <a>this page</a>. Sections with partially witheld information
    have and 'eyeball' icon next to their heading which you can click to display the extended version. If your access was not already
    redeemed you will be prompted for an access code first.

    My name is Jocelyn, or Josie, and I am an information technology professional and freelance Python
    developer located in the United States. I am passionate about building unique and fully customized websites that
    distinctly represent
    my clients' purpose. When I am not developing websites, I apply my Python skillset by writing scripts for various
    purposes on Windows and Linux-based distributions. Aside from software development, I enjoy expanding my IT toolkit
    in other areas such as
    Linux system administration, writing applications for personal projects, and network security.
</p>
<p>
    When I am not focused on technology I enjoy taking a break from sitting indoors so I can tend to my physical
    and mental health through exercise, meditation, and attending events and social gatherings with like-minded
    individuals in my community.
